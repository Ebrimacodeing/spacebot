<p class="typing">EVE is a adventure and exploration game where you can be a loner or you could be a commander or the highest rank of a general . In eve you can go to planets that humanity will never be able to go to and when you get there you can mine for money or claim the planet also in this game there are clans and wars you can be apart of them or just explore. I would suggest playing this game because it will teach you a lot about space and planets.<a href="https://www.eveonline.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ohm_plt:search_sem:brand_tg:ssa_cntr:ww_lan:eng_t:exact&utm_term=cid-413152694,agi-1350201182782866,adi-,tid-kwd-84388058669615,dev-c,reg-59981&msclkid=40c7df0150b41d23d42ebf9c3fb78691"><button>CLICK</button></a></p>
