<h4>Space is a vast place that is endless and has not been explored that much we have only been to the moon but one day we will explore galexzies far far away from earth and maybe colonzie one like for example mars . One reason we should explore the universe/space is  because there is nothing like the thrill when you discover something new there are no limits to what people can do if they do not try . The earth is dieing slowly because of global warming and one day it will be over for the earth and non habitabal and in my opion i dont think people get that climate change is a threat and one day it will destroy the earth that is why we need to colonize other plants and things because one day the earth will be no longer liveable . If we dont take action millions of people could die to golbal warming and other factors . I hope this helped you change your mind about space and global warming </h4>
